Building and Serving Locally
----------------------------

To build and serve a local site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), run the following command in
the root directory:

    $ chcp 65001
    $ jekyll serve

The first line is to change the code page of the console windows to UTF-8, to avoid the
"Liquid Exception: Incompatible character encoding" error during the site generation process.
